Key Takeaways:
Designing something is much more difficult when you're coding it. Despite that, I have still found satisfaction in my final output. To me, HTML and CSS are essentially similar to lego blocks. You don't need to be skilled in placing the blocks, you just need imagination and creativity to build whatever you want.
